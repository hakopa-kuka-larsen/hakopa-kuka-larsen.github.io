<h1> Emotional Intellegence</h1>

 
    <h3> What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

    <p>Emotional intelligence is how self-aware you are and how available you are to regulate your own emotions. In short, it describes your ability to regulate your own emotions and behaviours consciously, as well as an awareness of others' emotions and head spaces.</p>
    
    <p> this could and does happen everyday (if you go outside) whether it’s one on one, or perhaps more complex situations in a group, maybe that group has certain hierarchies or biases, there are internal and complex links between people and yourself that when made aware to the self, can be utilised to affect your life in positive ways. It can influence your ability to self motivate and create internal discipline that is rewarding and beneficial.   </p>
  
    <h3> How is EQ different from IQ? </h3>

    <p>Emotional intelligence quotient and intelligence quotient are different yet important parts of our life, IQ describes your ability to problem solve, your ability to apply logic and understand new ideas quickly, whereas EQ enables you to problem solve your own emotions recognise and identify your feelings, ideally becoming more in control and simply aware of your life and energy.</p>
    
    <p> I personally believe there are so many factors that influence your emotional competency, such as trauma, parenting, culture and so on. An extension of this is realising that every single person is going through their own journey and has their own unique and individual path they are traversing. Your emotional competency and intelligence are not entirely separate , utilize these two functions together to strengthen your personal and professional life.  </p>

    <h3> Why is EQ important?</h3>

    <P>
        EQ is important to your wellbeing, it impacts your ability to succeed your goals and connect to the people around you, it can even help with addiction, depression and more. The world is big and confusing, forever shifting and changing, you can better understand the whirlwind of information around us, the planet is happening all at once in the same way, but is perceived uniquely and individually for every single human being on this planet, I love the word sonder <a id="inline-link" href="#sonder"><b>[1]</b></a> to describe this phenomenon. Your ability to empathise with the idea of the individual can help especially in the tech industry.
        </P>
        
   <p> As technology has improved, employers today are looking for those who can reach an emotional quotient and fit the culture of the job they're applying for. Can this person be trusted to self-motivate? Will they work well in a team? How will they manage conflict? The need for pure intellect isn’t null but perhaps more niche to specifics in the industry, such as computer science, experimental programming and so on.  </p>

   <p>Your IQ is still necessary to actually carry out the tasks provided but weight has changed for hiring over the years, and let's be honest, I think it's safe to assume everyone taking this course is trying to get a job  somewhere vaguely within the base skillsets we are learning. It seems through excerpts i’ve read from Chade-Meng Tan’s <a id="inline-link" href="#GOOGLE"><b>[2]</b></a> “Search Inside “yourself” that tech tries to be progressive and has succeeded in many ways to drastically change the working environments of many offices across the world</p>

    “Sonder - n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.”
    ― John Koenig, The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</p>
