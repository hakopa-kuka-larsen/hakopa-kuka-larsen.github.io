                This is a concept that im familiar with myself, 

                Iv‚Äôe had the odd day here or there where I‚Äôve just sat at the desk for the whole part of the day, but most of the time I remember to get out of the houseI love going for a walk just up the hill in Strathmore park, through the bush and to a good lookout of breaker bay. At least once a week I like to go snorkeling (if the weather permits) and I find that taking moments in the water and in your walks to stop, breathe in your surroundings and notice the steady changes of the whenua. Gathering food and cooking togther in grattitude is a great way of connecting with your whƒÅnau.

                 For the past month my sister and baby nephew have been staying with us for the last month, and it has felt like a small family along with my partner. The rhythm of the day is waking, working then cooking and sharing together. I have been enjoying this sort of lifestyle at the moment. Your whanau and your friends are the Taha whƒÅnau. They are walls that support you. I will continue to reach out to my friends and family in balance with my studies.

                I would also like to find more regular sleeping patterns for the rest of this course, getting around 7 hours would bee preeeetty ideal. At home we aet amazing and varied kai (asian is my fav: char keow tao üò§ üò§ üò§  ) at home as both my partner and I love to cook

                I want to practice my mindfulness each day in somee I haven't been consistent so far to my first drafted <a href="learning-plan.html" id="inline-link"> Learning Plan" 
                 </a>One of my goals during this course is to allot time everyday to a form of mediation. I plan on setting aside 15 minutes in the morning everyday to pick a guided meditation or just a breathing exercise. I will mark off each day with the calender below.
