    <!-- BOOT CAMP -->

    <h1>Boot Camp Learning Plan</h1>

<p>
  I want to complete this course with a strong foundation in full-stack development. My short-term goal is to find stability in an early programming job. I don’t mind where I start, but I’d like to gain professional experience first. This goal is dynamic, as we haven't covered these topics in depth yet, so I’m not fully aware of the scope of potential career pathways.
</p>
<p>
  After this course, I have a lot of traveling planned, so finding part-time or remote work would be extremely beneficial. Additionally, I have multiple obligations and time commitments due to my music career. My long-term goal is to secure a programming job that I genuinely enjoy—ideally one that allows for flexibility in travel or relocation. I'm highly interested in video game development, music software development (such as DAWs and music plug-ins), and the intersection of music hardware and software. I have a deep love for design and a strong creative spark.
</p>
<h3>Strengths and Challenges</h3>
<p>
  I believe my strengths during this bootcamp will be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>My ability to work well in teams</li>
  <li>Effective communication of ideas</li>
  <li>Leveraging the knowledge of facilitators through questions and discussions</li>
</ul>

<p>However, a potential challenge for me is my willingness to share when I don’t understand something. When I’m stuck or in need of guidance, I tend to hesitate instead of reaching out for help. For the duration of this course, I want to let go of my ego and build confidence in openly sharing my thoughts and questions with the group.</p>

<p>In terms of technical skills, I feel relatively confident in my basic understanding of <em>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</em>. However, I haven’t fully developed my skills with JavaScript objects and do not yet have mastery of the common methods we've been using.</p>

<h3>Personal Growth Goals</h3>

<p>I would like to see improvement in my ability to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Speak confidently in front of a group</li>
  <li>Share and stand by my ideas</li>
  <li>Receive, integrate, and effectively provide constructive feedback</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expectations of the Bootcamp Team</h3>

<p>I expect the bootcamp team to be <em>open, communicative, and patient</em>. I also expect the coordinators and facilitators to clearly lay out tasks and be available to clarify concepts both during and, when possible, outside of course hours.</p>

<h3>Commitment to Learning</h3>

<p>I am here at Dev Academy to learn how to code. Coding is about creating products for people, by people, and I strive to work collaboratively—pushing myself and my peers to grow. I will treat my fellow students and teachers with kindness and patience, and I will listen attentively. I will seek help in a timely manner by reaching out to facilitators when needed.</p>

<p>If I fall behind on a project or am unable to complete something for any reason, I will <em>prioritize honesty</em> and communicate clearly with the people involved so as not to hinder my own or anyone else’s learning. This course is condensed into a short time frame, and I am prepared for the intensity and challenges ahead. In fact, I’m really excited for it.</p>




<!-- FOUNDATIONS -->
  
<h1> Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
<br>
 
    <h3> What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    </h3>
  
  <p>My long term goals are to start a career in the tech industry, get my foot into the door of office environment jobs, in tech I would love to be a developer. I would love to get an internship out of this course to initiate and develop my soft skills in these particular working environments. I have dreams of creating my own personal projects as well, app design, game design etc.interests. Another goal is to find a balance of work to hobby ratio that works for me. I wil always be creating music and touring etc so figuring out a way to manage these two avenues, wether its finding remotely available work, or prioritizing my coureeer pathway to better reflect a likely outcome.
  </p>  





     <h3> A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
  
     <p>
      My strengths in learning are my creativity, curiosity and kindness/fairness.  I am likely to find unique solutions and enjoy learning at depth on subjects. For most information to be locked in to the memory banks I need to know why something happens, why something works. During the previous DEV tasks I have found myself going down a rabbit hole to underdsdtand the core of an element. This can be beneficial to truly understanding something, and ideally being able to utilise it modularly, but I know that this rabbit hole can be detrimental to the outlined learning expectancies. Remembering to refer back to the original task after branching and flowering out so far. 
</p>
      
      

 
  
<h3>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
</h3>  

<p>Learning to collaborate effectively in shared environments with strangers and friends alike, working effectively to a deadline (procrastination) and learning to effectively listen and loop. I can often find myself interjecting by nature and adding/assuming in conversations  before internalising the complete shared idea. I can be quite an anxious and shy person and talking to new people often causes me stress, but I know through practice and aware intent I can make this feel natural.</p>
