<h1> Learning Plan</h1>
<br>
 
    <h3> What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    </h3>
  
  <p>My long term goals are to start a career in the tech industry, get my foot into the door of office environment jobs, in tech I would love to be a developer. I would love to get an internship out of this course to initiate and develop my soft skills in these particular working environments. I have dreams of creating my own personal projects as well, app design, game design etc.interests. Another goal is to find a balance of work to hobby ratio that works for me. I wil always be creating music and touring etc so figuring out a way to manage these two avenues, wether its finding remotely available work, or prioritizing my coureeer pathway to better reflect a likely outcome.

     <h3> A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
  
     <p>
      My strengths in learning are my creativity, curiosity and kindness/fairness.  I am likely to find unique solutions and enjoy learning at depth on subjects. For most information to be locked in to the memory banks I need to know why something happens, why something works. During the previous DEV tasks I have found myself going down a rabbit hole to underdsdtand the core of an element. This can be beneficial to truly understanding something, and ideally being able to utilise it modularly, but I know that this rabbit hole can be detrimental to the outlined learning expectancies. Remembering to refer back to the original task after branching and flowering out so far.

<h3>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
</h3>  

<p>Learning to collaborate effectively in shared environments with strangers and friends alike, working effectively to a deadline (procrastination) and learning to effectively listen and loop. I can often find myself interjecting by nature and adding/assuming in conversations  before internalising the complete shared idea. I can be quite an anxious and shy person and talking to new people often causes me stress, but I know through practice and aware intent I can make this feel natural.</p>
