    <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>I have learned that I am a really stubborn person and a perfectionist. I deeply want to be able to solve things by myself, and I find it really gratifying—but this can sometimes be a hindrance to my own progress.<br>
    Especially in such a fast-paced course like this, I’ve realized that there is strength in collaboration. The people in my cohort have been so nice to work with and talk to, and even just having conversations about things unrelated to tech—like how we’re feeling during the course, the challenges we face, what frustrates us, and what brings us joy—has been valuable.</p>

    <p>We’ve shared different strategies and mindsets for approaching daily goals, and that has been really cool. I can’t wait to get to Bootcamp and be face-to-face with people. I feel like I excel more in a face-to-face environment.</p>

    <p>I’ve also learned that employers and co-workers in the tech industry tend to prioritize being progressive, kind, and positive. And it’s not just a vibe—it’s backed by science. Concepts like neuroplasticity, emotional intelligence, and different problem-solving approaches are all part of what makes a great developer.</p>

    <p>Lastly, I am moderately happy with my technical coding skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and with the way I’ve interacted with other students and sought help when needed. However, I want to develop this further during Bootcamp. I want to push myself into uncomfortable situations, engage with people, and be okay with being wrong in front of others. I know that the environment I’m in is a safe place to make mistakes, and that’s really valuable.</p>

    <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
    <p>Your values make you unique, and employers and teachers will take notice of them. But values differ from person to person. Empathy is your ability to understand others from their perspective, and that’s important because everyone thinks and works through problems differently.<br>
    You need to figure out how to communicate your ideas effectively to different people—whether they’re fellow developers, designers, or even people outside of tech.</p>

    <p>Empathy and self-awareness impact your ability to succeed in programming. They help you manage your emotions, frustrations, and overall mindset. For example, empathy is useful when deciding who to work with and how different people might collaborate best. Maybe someone is introverted and doesn’t enjoy pair programming as much as others. Maybe someone else is very social and needs to verbalize their thoughts in order to process them. Recognizing these differences can make teamwork more effective.</p>

    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>What surprised me the most is that, going into this course, I kind of glazed over the Human Skills portion. I knew it was something DEV Academy emphasized, but I didn’t realize how much depth it would have. And honestly, I enjoyed it.</p>

    <p>They included concepts like <em>Te Whare Tapa Whā</em> as a framework for mindfulness, giving us practical strategies to apply in our daily lives. It took me nearly the entire Foundations course to finally get comfortable reaching out to my cohort, but when I did, it really helped. There were things I struggled with for a long time that could have been solved much quicker if I had just asked for help.</p>

    <p>This experience has reinforced that, while computers and AI are powerful, humans are still at the center of the experience. We are building programs <strong>for people</strong>, so naturally, people are the most important part of the process. Communication, collaboration, and the ability to disagree and reach a consensus are essential skills for success.</p>

    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>The biggest challenge for me was actually putting these skills into practice—especially reaching out to others and admitting when I was stuck. I’ve always been someone who prefers to figure things out alone, but I’m learning that collaboration speeds up learning.</p>

    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p>I think this course is structured in a really smart way. The first five weeks mimic a remote working environment, where flipped learning puts you in charge of your own motivation and time management. You have to hold yourself accountable for completing tasks and meeting learning competencies—just like in a real job.</p>

    <p>By emphasizing Human Skills early on, the course prepares us for the reality of working in a team. In the industry, you aren’t just coding alone all day—you’re collaborating, communicating, and solving problems with others.</p>

    <h3>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>No, I don’t think the time spent on Human Skills was a waste. I don’t think I should have just used that time for programming, either.</p>

    <p>I trust that the technical skills will come with time and practice. There are so many programming languages and frameworks out there, and this course is just giving us a foundation to build on. But what I initially underestimated was how useful the Human Skills portion would be.</p>

    <p>I particularly appreciated the <em>human</em> parts of the course—like the promo videos for each sprint from Joseph. He speaks with a lot of empathy and explains common student experiences, like feeling behind compared to others who are posting in Discord all the time. Everyone comes from different backgrounds—some people find the course easy, others find it incredibly difficult, and most are somewhere in between. Understanding that has helped me manage my own expectations and approach learning with a healthier mindset.</p>
