                    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
                    
                      <p>
                        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity in itself has shown time and time again that students are much more capable of engaging deeply, and retaining information. This knowledge is powerful and scientific, a growth mindset and the belief that you can rewire and strengthen wires in your brain can actually improve your ability and enjoyment in learning.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        By rewarding process effort and strategy rather than explicitly self rewarding simply the completion or solving of a task, building this resilience to perceived social failure, pushing yourself outside of the usual comfort zone realises great improvements in learning. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        You can increase your neuroplasticity by repeating the same tasks everyday, practicing your craft or problem solving everyday and recognising and being mindful of the effort you're putting in, and the fact that your efforts will and can change the physical nature of your brain! I think combining a variety of different activities in balance can help improve your neural pathways. Such as daily exercise, practicing your instrument of craft everyday, trying short coding challenges, putting yourself in typically uncomfortable social settings, as well as a balance of family and friends time alone. Removing your base distractions can help too, less use of intermittent social media/gaming or any disruptions that would otherwise divide your ability to learn.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Having a direct and set goal for each day has really helped me so far. I eat breakfast, do a small workout, a short UCLA meditation, then write down my goals for the day. Firstly the technical goals, ie finish reflection, finish java kata 2 hours etc, and then mental goals, like don’t check your phone until lunch time, stand up and stretch during the day or even being grateful for where you are and the happiness you have. There are also notes from the previous session that I check that have been written at the end, such as getting frustrated during task ‘x’ or was distracted by ‘y’, and felt proud and excited about finishing and understanding ‘a’.

                      <p>
                        Through listening to this episode of the Huberman podcast I have learned that we are the products of our environments, our experiences and daily choices. Your nervous system is custom built and shaped through your life. The word plastic in this setting means malleable. We are born this way, with our brains fresh and wired loosely, this is why we learn so quickly when we are younger. We have evolved as a species to effectively adapt to whatever life, country or climate we are born into. Our survival as a species is because of this ability to learn and adapt. This also means that things like trauma and violence when younger or negative/addictive learned behaviours can negatively affect you as an adult, but importantly  this does not mean you can’t unlearn or more accurately change these pathways.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        A growth mindset is important to develop and continuously grow as an adult, your mind has the most plasticity when you are younger but we now know that your mind doesn't stop being capable of noticeable and affectable change. It’s important because it's relevant to your employers to know that you are capable of learning quickly and adapting. Many of us will land jobs that require us to adapt quickly to ideas/languages/methods/workflows that fall outside of the bounds of the course outline. I can see that this course itself is designed to factor these things in and prepare you for this mindset. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        I was surprised and agreed with Carol Dweck in her short TEDxTALK. I  think that there is so much weight in classic teaching programs as a child that you're either talented or not, you are gifted or not and that can't really be changed, which is crazy cause if I’m understanding this correctly, ironically this further impedes a student who might be struggling, this idea that they just are the way the are, and they should adjust accordingly, perhaps many teachers could learn from these realisations, and even adults today could learn a lot from these concepts. 
                      </p>
